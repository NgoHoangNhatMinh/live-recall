## Team members

- Name / student ID / responsibility

## Ubuntu setup

Exact commands from a fresh Ubuntu environment.

## Install

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Required server

```bash
python solution_server.py --port 8765
```

## Browser client

Exact commands/steps.

## Public deterministic tests

Exact commands and configuration used for T1-T5, including independent runs.

## Mandatory deterministic application demo

Exact commands/steps for `caption_source.py`, browser clients, revision replacement, recall, late join, and reconnect/recovery.

## Design notes

Briefly describe:

- revision/deduplication state;
- bounded server history;
- reconnect/late-join recovery;
- per-client buffering/backpressure policy;
- overload behavior and trade-offs.

## Optional ASR bonus

Only if attempted. Keep these dependencies separate from the mandatory server path.
